He was praised for his beauty and numerous statues and even temples where built to him. It seems that in the Roman world, men were praised for their beauty more than women.\nWhy do you think this changed? Do you feel comfortable calling a man \"beautiful\"? Do you think that men are in fact generally more beautiful than women and that it has nothing to do with your sexuality? Is the fact that in many species of animal, the males are more attractive than the females relevant?",

      "question": "In many places there has been a decline in the number of venues like pubs, clubs and gyms exclusively for gay and lesbian people, often replaced by venues that are explicitly gay friendly but open to everyone. On the other hand, more and more groups exclusively for lgbt people are appearing on Discord. Is it good or bad?",

Some use various medical interventions to make their bodies more male, such as hormone therapy or surgery, however many such men are anatomically female down below. Sorry for the slightly nsfw question, but as a cis-gender gay or bi man (with a penis), how do you feel about having vaginal sex with a trans-man?",

Given that young teenagers are sexual well before their 18th birthday, what does the term \"sexualisation of minors\" mean? Can a gay+ adult engage with a gay+ teen who has questions about sex and sexuality in a positive, constructive way or is any engagement at all online simply taboo?",

Since the 1970's he has become \" something of a cult figure in gay cultural circles\" and Elton John has a large collection of his works (-for some reason-). There is however no direct evidence that he was gay and a small number of Tuke curators push back at any suggestion that he was or that his art is homoerotic.\nWhat do you feel about “gay erasure” of historical figures?

Why is it then that when a person says that they’d prefer others to refer to them using those pronouns (they/their/them), some people object on the grounds that it doesn’t seem to be correct grammar to refer to a single person using them?\nIf you speak another language, what pronouns do you use for a person when you don’t know their gender?",
